# robot_presentation

Baxter gives interactive presentation to robotics research team at USF CARRT. 

Python Code along with ROS drives robot. 

See media folder for images taken during demo. 

The code is in the "weekly_status_10_9_14.py" file.  The code could be made more modular or object oriented but this was a quick and dirty implementation for an upcoming meeting.  The robot uses audio, visual, and head motions to give the presentation to the team as seen in the code.
