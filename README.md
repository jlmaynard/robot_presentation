The code is in the "weekly_status_10_9_14.py" file.  The code could be made more modular or object oriented but this was a quick and dirty implementation for an upcoming meeting.  The robot uses audio, visual, and head motions to give the presentation to the team as seen in the code. 

This is original code written by Jason Maynard Copyright 2014.
